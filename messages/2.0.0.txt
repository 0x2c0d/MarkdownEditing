# MarkdownEditing 2.0.0 Changelog

This is a major release for MarkdownEditing. In this document, you will find information about the update.

This release adds a syntax file for __GitHub flavored Markdown__ and makes it default for Markdown extensions (md, txt).

Sublime text has a native tiny package for Markdown. However, when MarkdownEditing is enabled, native package causes some conflicts. For this reason, MarkdownEditing will automatically disable it. Since it doesn't bring anything new over MarkdownEditing, this is not a loss.

It's suggested you take a look at `Packages\MarkdownEditing\README.md` file.

Feedback is always welcome. MarkdownEditing is hosted on https://github.com/ttscoff/MarkdownEditing/. What features would you like to see in the next version?
