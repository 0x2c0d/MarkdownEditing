# MarkdownEditing 2.1.5 Changelog

Your _MarkdownEditing_ plugin is updated. Enjoy new version. For any type of
feedback you can use [GitHub issues][issues].

## Bug Fixes

* "Insert References" commands get fixed. Select something and press `alt+ctrl+r` to try `insert_named_reference` command, and `super+ctrl+shift+r` to try `insert_numbered_reference`.

## New Features

* Four new commands added to command pallete (`Paste as Link`, `Paste as Reference`, `Insert Named Reference`, `Insert Numbered Reference`)
* New command: `Paste as Inline Link`

## Changes

* "Paste As Reference" works differently now. Depending on whether the clipboard content is a valid URL, `super+ctrl+r` generates a reference on your selection with clipboard content as URL link or link name.
