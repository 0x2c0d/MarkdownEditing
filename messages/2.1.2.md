# MarkdownEditing {version} Changelog

Your _MarkdownEditing_ plugin is updated. Enjoy new version. For any type of
feedback you can use [GitHub issues][issues].

## Bug Fixes

* Many fixes in linter.
* Fixed a syntax bug with block level HTML tags.

## New Feature

* New markdown files will be automatically renamed to the first title.

## Changes

* Lint command is renamed to `markdown_lint` (was `lint` before). If you set
custom keybinding for that, you need to update it with the new command name.

* Hotkey for linting is now removed. The command name for linting is "lint".
You can always add the following configuration to your user keymap file to
enable it.

    ```json
    { "keys": ["ctrl+shift+m"], "command": "markdown_lint", "context":
        [
            { "key": "selector", "operator": "equal", "operand": "text.html.markdown", "match_all": true }
        ]
     }
    ```

* Renamed settings key for lint feature to `mde.lint`. If you customized
one of those settings in you user settings file, you have to update `lint`
to `mde.lint`.
