# MarkdownEditing 2.0.5 Changelog

Your _MarkdownEditing_ plugin is updated. Enjoy new version. For any type of feedback you can use [GitHub issues][issues].

## Bug Fixes

* Fix a bug where `Enter` didn't remove _empty_ ordered list item if it's multi-digit.
* Some keybindings (`*`, `_` etc) were irrelevant for code blocks/spans. They are now disabled for inline and block code.
* Headers that don't have a blank line before and after didn't appear in the symbol list. Fixed.

## New Features

* At the end of a blockquote line, pressing `Enter` will now automatically extend blockquote.
* If a list item contains a [GFM task][], pressing `Enter` at the end of the line will continue with a new blank task.
