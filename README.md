# MarkdownEditing

### Better Markdown Editing features for Sublime Text 2

This package will make MarkdownEditor your default theme for Markdown/MultiMarkdown files. Adjust it to your liking or remove the line from the .sublime-settings files


* Asterisks and underscores are autopaired and will wrap selected text
* If you start an empty pair and hit backspace, both elements are deleted
* If you start an empty pair and hit space, the right element is deleted
* backticks are paired
* Left bracket pairing is modified to eliminate the selection and leave the cursor at a point where you can insert a `[]` or `()` pair for a link
* ⌘⌥V will paste the contents of the clipboard as an inline link on selected text
* ⌘⌥R will paste the contents of the clipboard as a reference link
* ⌘K inserts a standard inline link, ⌘⇧K inserts an inline image
* ⌘B and ⌘I are bound to bold and italics (Markdown). *If you don't like losing your default shortcut for "Build", modify the sublime-keymap file.*
