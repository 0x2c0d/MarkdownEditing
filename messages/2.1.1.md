# MarkdownEditing 2.1.1 Changelog

Your _MarkdownEditing_ plugin is updated. Enjoy new version. For any type of feedback you can use [GitHub issues][issues].

## Bug Fixes

* Lists containing list bullet characters (*, -, +) now can be properly indented.
* Some footnotes related commands are fixed.
* <_script_> code blocks now break markdown syntax hightlight less often (but still buggy).
* Many fixes in linter.

## New Features

* "Paste as link"(shortcut: ctrl+super+v(PC)/super+alt+v(MAC)) no longer requires a selection.
* ***Bold and italic*** rendering is now supported.
* New markdown files will be automatically renamed to the first title.

## Changes

* Hotkey for linting is now removed. The command name for linting is "lint". You can always add the following configuration to your user keymap file to enable it.
```json
{ "keys": ["ctrl+shift+m"], "command": "lint", "context":
    [
        { "key": "selector", "operator": "equal", "operand": "text.html.markdown", "match_all": true }
    ]
 }
```
