# MarkdownEditing 2.0.4 Changelog

Your _MarkdownEditing_ plugin is updated. Enjoy new version. For any type of feedback you can use [GitHub issues][issues].

## New Features

* Caret is now taller similar to iA Writer. Works in only Sublime Text Build 3057 and above.

## Changes

* Highlighting current line is now disabled. If you want it back, you can do so in your user settings file which is one of:
    - `Packages/User/Markdown.sublime-settings`
    - `Packages/User/Markdown (Standard).sublime-settings`
    - `Packages/User/MultiMarkdown.sublime-settings`

    If you are using the (immature) focus theme, you have to reenable "highlighting current line"; because, the focus theme relies on that. On the other hand, the theme is likely to be changed a lot or totally replaced by a new feature in the future.
