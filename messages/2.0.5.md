# MarkdownEditing 2.0.5 Changelog

Your _MarkdownEditing_ plugin is updated. Enjoy new version. For any type of feedback you can use [GitHub issues][issues].

## Bug Fixes

* Fix a bug where `Enter` didn't remove _empty_ ordered list item if it's multi-digit.
* Some keybindings (`*`, `_` etc) were irrelevant for code blocks/spans. They are now disabled for inline and block code.

## New Features

* At the end of a blockquote line, pressing `Enter` will now automatically extend blockquote.
