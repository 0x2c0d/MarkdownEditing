# MarkdownEditing 2.0.4 Changelog

Your _MarkdownEditing_ plugin is updated. Enjoy new version. For any type of feedback you can use [GitHub issues][issues].

## Bug Fixes

* Separator (`***`) background color was almost unnoticeable, fixed for all the themes.
* Space obligation after `>` in blockquotes was removed in previous versions but it didn't apply to the _standard_ Markdown syntax file. Fixed.

## New Features

* Caret is now taller similar to iA Writer. Works in only Sublime Text Build 3057 and above.

## Changes

* Highlighting current line is now disabled. If you want it back, you can do so in your user settings file which is one of:
    - `Packages/User/Markdown.sublime-settings`
    - `Packages/User/Markdown (Standard).sublime-settings`
    - `Packages/User/MultiMarkdown.sublime-settings`

    If you are using the (immature) focus theme, you have to reenable "highlighting current line"; because, the focus theme relies on that. On the other hand, the theme is likely to be changed a lot or totally replaced by a new feature in the future.

* Listening to _too many_ users, now the plugin doesn't set any font settings in the defaults. If you were happy with the default font settings, you may want to re-add them to your user settings file of your favorite flavor which is one of:
    - `Packages/User/Markdown.sublime-settings`
    - `Packages/User/Markdown (Standard).sublime-settings`
    - `Packages/User/MultiMarkdown.sublime-settings`

    The font settings for Mac/Linux were:

        "font_face": "Menlo",
        "font_options": [ "subpixel_antialias", "no_round", "directwrite"],

    and for Windows:

        "font_face": "Consolas"

* Bold and italic key bindings (`Ctrl B/I`) are changed due to some conflicts that are reported several time by users. They are now:
    - `Super Alt B/I` for OS X
    - `Ctrl Shift B/I` for Windows/Linux
