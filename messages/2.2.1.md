# MarkdownEditing 2.2.1 Changelog

Your _MarkdownEditing_ plugin is updated. Enjoy new version. For any type of
feedback you can use [GitHub issues][issues].

Just FYI, you can change the color theme of MarkdownEditing. If you are willing to do so, there are [Dark][github 2] and [yellow][github 3] theme available, plus [thirdparty themes](additional-color-themes). See [configuration](configuration) section to learn **how to change the theme**.

## Bug Fixes

## New Features

* `Shift+Tab` is now default key binding to toggle folding in current sections.
* `Ctrl/Command+Shift+Tab` now toggle folding in all sections under headings of same level. FYI, `Ctrl+k,j(0)` is a default key binding that unfolds everything.
* `Ctrl/Command+(Shift)+;`, `Ctrl/Command+(Shift)+.` help you navigate to the next or previous heading of the same/any(with Shift) level.
